open Graph

(* returns a new graph having the same nodes than gr, but no arc. (code : one line)
In order to find your errors more quickly, you may add an annotation : let clone_nodes (gr:'a graph) = ... *)
val clone_nodes: 'a graph -> 'b graph

(* maps all arcs of gr by function f. (â©½3 lines) *)
val gmap: 'a graph -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b graph

(* adds n to the value of the arc between id1 and id2. If the arc does not exist, it is created. *)
(* val add_arc: int graph -> id -> id -> int -> int graph *)
